\title{Data on the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in a school in Pennsylvania.}
\format{A list of two elements: 
\describe{
  \item{Incidence}{a dataframe with 32 lines containing dates in first column, and daily incidence in second column,}
  \item{SI.Distr}{a vector containing a set of 12 probabilities.}

\description{
This data set gives:
1/ the daily incidence of onset of acute respiratory illness 
(ARI, defined as at least two symptoms among fever, cough, sore throat, and runny nose)
amongst children in a school in Pennsylvania during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (see source and references),
2/ the discrete daily distribution of the serial interval for influenza, assuming a shifted Gamma distribution with mean 2.6 days, standard deviation 1.5 days and shift 1 day (see references).

\examples{
## load data on pandemic flu in a school in 2009
data("Flu2009")

## estimate the reproduction number (method "NonParametricSI")
EstimateR(Flu2009$Incidence, 
          T.Start=2:26, T.End=8:32, 
          method="NonParametricSI", SI.Distr=Flu2009$SI.Distr, 
          plot=TRUE, date_col = 1)
# the second plot produced shows, at each each day, 
# the estimate of the reproduction number 
# over the 7-day window finishing on that day.
